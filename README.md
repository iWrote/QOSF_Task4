# QOSF_Task4
dabbling in hybrid quantum-classical computing

`Task4_analysis.pdf` has some MATLAB snippets regarding how I found an ansatz.  
`Task4_VQE.pdf` == `Task4_VQE.ipynb` contain a qiskit implementation of VQE for the given matrix.
# Curve shows min. eigenvalue ~ -1.
Single parameter circuit. Fancy optimization seemed unnecessary; could've use something like Newton Raphson to find minimum if I was running on IBMq backend.

tutorial notes are from the qiskit textbook
